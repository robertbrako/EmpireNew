Empire

Android game vintage 2012.
Published to demonstrate Android experience.  Noteworthy code samples:
* src\main\java\com\rmbcorp\empire\Views\Locator.java # locate()
* src\main\java\com\rmbcorp\empire\util\TerrainMatrix.java # spawn()
* src\main\java\com\rmbcorp\empire\RuleManager.java # getAllowables()

Project is weak in terms of code-cleanliness and architecture.  I'll consider cleaning it up, but I have higher-priority projects like my IT infrastructure, my tax software, and, oh yes - work.

I did start a few rounds of cleanup, re-structuring the whole project, adding unit test support, etc.
